# Word Play Game 👾
- Word Play is a word guessing game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and provides a hint for that word. The player's objective is to guess the word by inputting one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses, and incorrect guesses are displayed.
